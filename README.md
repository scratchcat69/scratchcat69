- 👋 Hi, I’m @scratchcat69 (aka Tim)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python and Git/GitHub to increase my Developer skill sets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Git and Docker
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything, just yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ...

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my IT career as a programmer in the late 80's.  Nearly 40 years later, coding it is!
